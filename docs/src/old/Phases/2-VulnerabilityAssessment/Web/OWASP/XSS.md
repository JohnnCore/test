## DOM
This is a type of XSS attack where the vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. The malicious script is embedded in the HTML page and is executed by the victim's browser when the page is loaded. This makes it more difficult to detect and prevent, as it does not involve the server at all.
One good example is search bar.

## REFLECTED  
In this type of attack, the malicious script is part of the victim's request to the website. The website includes this script in its response, which is then executed by the victim's web browser. Find some URL where it looks like ?q=something.

## STORED/PERSISTED
In this type of attack, the malicious script is injected into a website's database. This script is then served to the website's users when they request it, leading to the execution of the script in their web browsers. An example of a stored XSS attack is when an attacker injects a comment containing malicious code on a website, and that code is served to other users who view the comment.
