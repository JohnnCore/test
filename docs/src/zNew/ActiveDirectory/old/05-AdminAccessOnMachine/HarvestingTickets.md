# Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows
We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT). It can be:

    - `Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.`
    - `Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.`

Before we perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack, let's see some methods to get a ticket using Mimikatz [https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz] and Rubeus [https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus].


On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it. As a non-administrative user, you can only get your tickets, but as a local administrator, you can collect everything.

We can harvest all tickets from a system using the Mimikatz module sekurlsa::tickets /export. The result is a list of files with the extension .kirbi, which contain the tickets.

## Mimikatz - Export Tickets
```
> mimikatz.exe
> privilege::debug
> sekurlsa::tickets /export
> exit
> dir *.kirbi
```

The tickets that end with $ correspond to the computer account, which needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory. User tickets have the user's name, followed by an @ that separates the service name and the domain, for example: [randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi.

`Note: If you pick a ticket with the service krbtgt, it corresponds to the TGT of that account.`


- `Note: At the time of writing, using Mimikatz version 2.2.0 20220919, if we run "sekurlsa::ekeys" it presents all hashes as des_cbc_md4 on some Windows 10 versions. Exported tickets (sekurlsa::tickets /export) do not work correctly due to the wrong encryption. It is possible to use these hashes to generate new tickets or use Rubeus to export tickets in base64 format.`

## Rubeus - Export Tickets
```
> Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
```

`Note: To collect all tickets we need to execute Mimikatz or Rubeus as an administrator.`

This is a common way to retrieve tickets from a computer. Another advantage of abusing Kerberos tickets is the ability to forge our own tickets. Let's see how we can do this using the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key technique.
