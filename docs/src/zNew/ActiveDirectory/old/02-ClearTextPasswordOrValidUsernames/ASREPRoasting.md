# ASREPRoasting
It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way. The authentication service reply (AS_REP) is encrypted with the accountâ€™s password, and any domain user can request it.

With pre-authentication, a user enters their password, which encrypts a time stamp. The Domain Controller will decrypt this to validate that the correct password was used. If successful, a TGT will be issued to the user for further authentication requests in the domain. If an account has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for the affected account and retrieve an encrypted TGT from the Domain Controller. This can be subjected to an offline password attack using a tool such as Hashcat or John the Ripper.


ASREPRoasting is similar to Kerberoasting, but it involves attacking the AS-REP instead of the TGS-REP. An SPN is not required. This setting can be enumerated with PowerView or built-in tools such as the PowerShell AD module.
The attack itself can be performed with the Rubeus toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. If an attacker has GenericWrite or GenericAll permissions over an account, they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password before disabling the attribute again. Like Kerberoasting, the success of this attack depends on the account having a relatively weak password.

Below is an example of the attack. PowerView can be used to enumerate users with their UAC value set to DONT_REQ_PREAUTH.

**Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser**
```
PS > Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl
```

With this information in hand, the Rubeus tool can be leveraged to retrieve the AS-REP in the proper format for offline hash cracking. This attack does not require any domain user context and can be done by just knowing the SAM name for the user without Kerberos pre-auth. We will see an example of this using Kerbrute later in this section. Remember, add the /nowrap flag so the ticket is not column wrapped and is retrieved in a format that we can readily feed into Hashcat.

**Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus**
```
PS > .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:<USERNAME> /nowrap /format:<hashcat|john> /outfile:<output_hashes_file>
```


When performing user enumeration with Kerbrute, the tool will automatically retrieve the AS-REP for any users found that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication.

## Retrieving the AS-REP Using Kerbrute
```
$ kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```

With a list of valid users, we can use Get-NPUsers.py from the Impacket toolkit to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required. The tool will retrieve the AS-REP in Hashcat format for offline cracking for any found. We can also feed a wordlist such as jsmith.txt into the tool, it will throw errors for users that do not exist, but if it finds any valid ones without Kerberos pre-authentication, then it can be a nice way to obtain a foothold or further our access, depending on where we are in the course of our assessment. Even if we are unable to crack the AS-REP using Hashcat it is still good to report this as a finding to clients (just lower risk if we cannot crack the password) so they can assess whether or not the account requires this setting.

## Hunting for Users with Kerberoast Pre-auth Not Required
```bash
$ GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -no-pass -usersfile valid_ad_users 

# check ASREPRoast for all domain users (credentials required)
$ python GetNPUsers.py <domain_name>/<domain_user>:<domain_user_password> -request -format <AS_REP_responses_format [hashcat | john]> -outputfile <output_AS_REP_responses_file>

# check ASREPRoast for a list of users (no credentials required)
$ python GetNPUsers.py <domain_name>/ -usersfile <users_file> -format <AS_REP_responses_format [hashcat | john]> -outputfile <output_AS_REP_responses_file>
```

We have now covered a few ways that we can perform an ASREPRoasting attack from both Windows and Linux hosts and witnessed how we do not need to be on a domain-joined host to a) enumerate accounts that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication and b) perform this attack and obtain an AS-REP to crack offline to either gain a foothold in the domain or further our access.
